# HANDOFF_LOG.md — School-Hive (client)

Session-by-session handoff log. **Newest entry at the top.**
Every session that does meaningful work appends a dated entry here before finishing
(or before hitting a token/budget limit) and commits + pushes it.
Format: one entry per session, `YYYY-MM-DD` heading, then a short summary of
DONE / IN PROGRESS / LEFT / DECISIONS & CONTEXT.

## 2026-08-31 — Session-continuity system setup

**What was done**
- Created the session-continuity system: `AGENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `docs/CREDENTIALS.md`, and a `session-handoff` skill under `.ai-ready/skills/`.
- Baked standing working rules into `AGENTS.md`: commit after every small unit of progress, push after every commit, and emergency commit+push before running out of token budget (with continuity files updated first).
- Stored deploy credentials OUTSIDE the repo at `~/.config/school-hive/deploy.env` (Vercel token + Firebase token; see `docs/CREDENTIALS.md`). Added a placeholder `deploy.env` file to `.gitignore` in both repos so no credential file can ever be committed.
- Hardened `.gitignore`: added `deploy.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, and an explicit `!.env.example` keep-rule.

**Decisions & context**
- Chose the `AGENTS.md` convention (used by opencode, Cursor, Claude Code) as the single always-loaded rules file, with `TASKS.md` + `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md` as the state/narrative, and a `session-handoff` skill as the ritual future agents load on start.
- Secrets are NEVER committed to either repo. The only in-repo artifact is a registry (`docs/CREDENTIALS.md`) that says *what* exists and *where* it lives, not the values.
- The client had no test framework; `npm run lint` is the main gate. Builds via `npm run build`.

**In progress**
- Nothing. Baseline established.

**Left / next**
- See `TASKS.md` BACKLOG for candidate work (no automated tests, server URL hardcoded in axios hooks, duplicated card components, etc.).
